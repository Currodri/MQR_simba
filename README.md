# SH_Project
Codes for the finding of mergers and quenching events in SIMBA progen data
-----------------------------------
In this repository I include the codes that were developed for the SH Project at the Institute of Astronomy, Edinburgh
during the months of January - March 2019.

This version includes example codes in which the results from the mergerFinder and quenchingFinder codes are used.

Both codes require dictionaries of GalaxyData objects. These objects need to be feed with the results of the progen analysis of
SIMBA data.

If you would like to use any of this package, please cite the original paper about the algorithms Rodriguez et al. (2019):

For any questions about the code, please don't hesitate to contact me: Curro Rodriguez Montero (s1650043@ed.ac.uk).
