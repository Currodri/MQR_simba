Codes for the finding of mergers and quenching events in SIMBA progen data
-----------------------------------
In this repository I include the codes that were developed for the SH Project at the Institute of Astronomy, Edinburgh
during the months of January - March 2019.

Both codes require dictionaries of GalaxyData objects. These objects need to be feed with the results of the progen analysis of
SIMBA data.

For any questions about the code, please don't hesitate to contact me: Curro Rodriguez Montero (s1650043@ed.ac.uk).
