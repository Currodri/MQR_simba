# MQR_simba
Codes for the finding of mergers and quenching events in SIMBA progen data, as well as the cross-matching
with photometry data catalogues
-----------------------------------
In this repository I include the codes that were developed for the SH Project at the Institute of Astronomy, Edinburgh
during the months of January - March 2019.

This version includes example codes in which the results from the mergerFinder and quenchingFinder codes are used.

Both codes require dictionaries of GalaxyData objects. These objects need to be feed with the results of the progen analysis of SIMBA data.

For a more simple use of all the data obtained about mergers, rejuvenations, quenching and photometry, gen_pickle.py joins everything together in a dictionary of galaxies.

If you would like to use any of this package, please cite the original paper about the algorithms Rodriguez et al. (2019):
